            This controls how much revising the deck affects how well you remember the deck.<br>
            When you revise a deck for the second time you will take longer to forget it than when you revised it the first time.<br>
            The change constant affects how big a difference between those times there is.<br>
            A higher value means there is less change, so you will revise more often.<br>

<div id="spaced_repetition_graph_explanation">
Below shows a graph of memory retention using the given values for the threshold at which to revise, the steepness of the graph, and the change constant.<br>
Each black vertical line represents the day you revise the deck with the given routine. Whenever you do that, your memory retention of the deck goes back to 1 (1 for 100%).<br>
The more times you revise the deck, the longer it takes for you to forget the deck, so your memory retention stays higher for longer.<br>
This gives revision dates that are spaced out from eachother, timed for whenever you are beginning to really forget the deck.<br>
By changing the threshold at which you are reminded to revise, the steepness constant, and the change constant you can control the shape of the graph and your schedule for revision.<br>
You will be reminded to revise the deck with the given routine whenever the memory retention goes below the given threshold, as calculated with your saved values.<br>
You might not revise the deck every time you are reminded, or on the same day that you are reminded. This would give a differently shaped out graph as the one presented below, but it would be a similar sort of schedule.<br>
Use the tooltips for each variable (threshold, steepness and constant) to understand their impact better.<br>
<br>
The graph is a transformed graph of e^-x, as this gives a line that declines quickly at first and then slows down, never quite reaching zero.<br>
This is similar to the forgetting curve, which is what spaced repetition is based off of.
